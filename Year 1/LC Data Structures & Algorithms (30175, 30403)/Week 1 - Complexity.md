Types of complexities
- Worst Case
	- Worst complexity over all possible inputs/situations (complexity upper bound)
- Average
	- Average complexity over all random choices
	- For randomised algorithms, or algorithms where the likelihood of each of the inputs are known
- Amortised
	- Average time taken over a sequence of consecutive operations
	- used for measuring data structure performance
